The problem is to determine the total cost of purchasing chess pieces based on the input of a string representing the types of pieces and their quantities, where 'Q' costs 9, 'K' costs 4, 'B' costs 3, 'N' costs 3, 'P' costs 1, and 'R' costs 5. The string will be passed to the function and based on the input the cost is calculated by summing the values corresponding to each piece. If the input string contains the character 'K', the final total cost is multiplied by 200, otherwise it is multiplied by 100. The solution then prints out the final total cost.
