Find the sum of N complex numbers and print the square of that number. The symbol i represents the imaginary unit which is equal to the square root of -1.

The sum of two complex numbers can be calculated using equation:
a+bi + c+di = (a+c) + (b+d)i

The square of a complex number a+bi can be calculated using binomial theorem:
(a + bi)^2 = a^2 + (2*a*b)i + (bi)^2 = (a^2 - b^2) + (2*a*b)i

For example the sum of the complex numbers 0+1i, -2-3i and 4+5i is
(0-2+4) + (1-3+5)i = 2+3i

and the square of that number is
(2+3i)^2 = (2*2) + (2*2*3)i + (3i*3i) = -5+12i

Input
Line 1: An integer N for the number of complex numbers.
Next N lines: N strings representing complex numbers, for example "-3+1i". If either the real or the imaginary part is 0 they will still be printed (for example 0 would be printed as "0+0i").


Output
A string representing a complex number, for example "4-3i". If either real or imaginary part is 0 it should still be printed (for example 0 would be printed as "0+0i").
